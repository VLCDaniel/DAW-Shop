# Online-Shop
This project was made to express the knowledge acquired during the course of Web Application Development within the University Of Bucharest using the architecture ASP.NET MVC5. 

### Online-Shop is a web application which can be easily used by both producer and consumer, where people have a large variety of products grouped in categories they can buy online.

Bellow is a list of most important points the application covers:
- [Home Page](#home)
<a name="home"/>

## Home page
The default page contains a list of Products and by clicking on the Show button, the user is redirected to a page
containing informations about that specific product.
The navbar provides a searching tool which looks up the given phrase in question Titles, Content, or Comments

Home page:

Every product page contains information like:
